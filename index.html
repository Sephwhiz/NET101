                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Topology is like a map showing how devices connect. Star = all roads meet at town center. Bus = one main highway. Ring = circular road around town."

                question: "It is nothing more than two or more computers connected by a cable or by a wireless radio connection so that they can exchange information.",

                correct: 1,

                correct: 0,

                correct: 0,

                correct: 3,
                explanation: "TCP = like registered mail (guaranteed delivery, slow). UDP = like shouting across street (fast, might not hear). Both move data between apps."

                correct: 3,

                correct: 2,

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "You (user) start at top (Application). Data travels down layers like packing a gift: wrap (Presentation) → add note (Session) → box (Transport) → address label (Network) → tape (Data Link) → hand to courier (Physical)."

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "One main cable runs through all computers—like train track. All devices connect to this track. Cut track = train stops."

                question: "Bits are packaged into frames at which layer of the OSI model?",

                correct: 1,

                question: "Client/server networks are a bit more complex and quite a bit more expensive than peer-to-peer networks. In a client/server network, one main computer called a server or domain controller handles network management.",

                correct: 0,

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Old habit. Early 2000s used real hubs. Now switches replaced them, but some still say 'hub' like saying 'dial phone' for mobile."

                correct: 1,
